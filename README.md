## ✨ Features Explained

### 🧠 Intelligent Branding with Custom Logo
The interface displays a custom-designed **brain + orbit** logo beside the chatbot name **MindOrbit**, reinforcing the blend of neuroscience and futuristic design. It sets the tone for an intelligent yet user-friendly experience.

### 💬 Clean, Glassmorphic Chat UI
MindOrbit uses modern design techniques such as **glassmorphism** (blurred background panels), **neon accent colors**, and **soft shadows** to deliver a visually appealing and intuitive layout.

Messages are grouped into:
- **User messages** — aligned to the right in a vibrant blue bubble  
- **Elara (bot) messages** — aligned left, styled in a muted purple tone with a planet emoji avatar

### ✨ Personalized Assistant (Elara)
From the first interaction, users are introduced to **Elara**, your AI guide, through a short greeting banner. This gives the chatbot a character, making conversations feel more human and memorable.

### 📋 One-Click Copy Feature
Each bot response is followed by a **Copy** button with a custom icon. When clicked, the content is instantly copied to the clipboard, and the button gives **instant visual feedback** by changing its label to “Copied!”

### ⬇️ Save to Text File
Alongside the copy button is a **Download** feature that allows users to **download Elara’s message as a `.txt` file**. This is implemented in pure JavaScript and does not require any server-side processing.

### 🪐 Animated Typing Placeholder
While Elara processes a request, a visual typing indicator (`…`) appears, giving a sense of responsiveness and realism. It enhances the UX by preventing abrupt message pops and sets a natural pacing.

### 🧠 Responsive Design & Mobile Support
MindOrbit is built mobile-first. It **automatically adjusts layout** and font sizes across all devices. On smaller screens:
- The logo becomes a compact icon  
- Header text resizes or hides  
- Bubbles and input adjust for finger-friendly typing
